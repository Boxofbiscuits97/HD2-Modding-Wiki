# Texture Atlas

A `texture atlas` is a combination of `textures` formed into a bigger `texture` that can be assigned to a single `material`. The creation of a `texture atlas` is required when the model you want to mod into the game has more `material` than the HD2 object you want to modify.

## Creation

The `texture` atlas can be created primarily in two different ways: Material Combiner Plugin and Re-UVMap baking.

### Material Combiner Plugin

If you have not already installed this plugin, you can grab the download link [here](../overview).

This method will require you to have already baked out the `textures` you need or having `textures` in `.png` format. If you have `textures` but not in a usable format, please visit [this](./texture-baking) section on how to bake textures.
