- `7820702089764710742` - This plays while NOT focused on the Galactic Map.

#### Misc Notes
There have been reports of timing issues with these wems. We advise making your music fit the exact timing of the original wems. If you don't adhere to the timing your music may abruptly restart.
- All three wems have the duration of `216571.41666666666`
Easiest way to make sure your music fits the timing is to go into the Audio Modding Tool. 
> Right-click on any of the three wems
> dump as .wav
> import that file into Audacity and slide the gain down so it's silent.
