# Rig Editing

Editing the rig of any unit in Helldivers 2 is deeply intertwined with said unitâ€™s animations. This is because many, if not most, of the animations in the game have an initial starting position for the locations of the bones.

This means that if you want to modify the rig of a unit in any way, you will likely need to modify all of its animations for the changes to function properly.
