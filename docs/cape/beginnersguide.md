# Cape Modding: Beginner's Course
Welcome to the beginning of your Cape Modding Adventure.

This guide is aimed at those who have never made a mod before and would like to get started.

If you feel this guide holds your hand too much please check out our [Intermediate Guide](./intermediateguide.md)

## Tools Needed
If you haven't already, download the following files.

#### [Blender 4.0](https://www.blender.org/download/previous-versions/)
The way we'll be using Blender is more akin to a menu. You won't need any prior Blender Experience to complete this course.

::: warning
Blender Version **4.0** is absolutely required. 

Any version from 4.0 to 4.3 will suffice but versions beyond WILL NOT WORK.
:::

#### [Helldivers 2 SDK](https://github.com/Boxofbiscuits97/HD2SDK-CommunityEdition/releases/latest)
Essential Software that we'll plug into Blender that will allow us to make our mod. **Don't unzip this.**

#### [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/)
This is a free image editor that we'll be using to make adjustments to our files.
::: warning
I'll be using GIMP 2.10 in this course.

But any version of GIMP 2 will work the same. The only difference will be the appearance and layout of the application.

## Section 1: Setup
In this section we'll get our battlestation fully operational.

### Adding the SDK
After you have downloaded and install all three programs open `Blender 4.0`.

Once Blender is open, left-click `Edit` -> `Preferences`
![EditPreferences](../public/images/cape-beginnersguide/edit-preferences.png)

Make sure the `Add-ons` section is highlighted blue on the left-side navigation bar. If it is not, left-click on it. 

Afterwards left-click on `Install...` in the top-right of the window.
![addonsinstall](../public/images/cape-beginnersguide/addons-install.png)

Next we'll select our zipped SDK file by left-clicking once. Then left-click the blue button on the bottom right of the file view window labelled `Install Add-on`. 
![installSDK](../public/images/cape-beginnersguide/install-addon.png)

Then we'll enable the SDK Add-on by:
- Using the search bar on the top right to enter the term `Helldiver`.
- Left-click the box next to `Import-Export: Helldivers 2 SDK: Community Edition` so it shows a checked box.

Leave this window open for the next segment.

### GIMP File Path
To start off we'll need to find out `GIMP-x.x.exe` file.

To do this press the `Windows Button` and type `GIMP`. The top result should be `GIMP` followed by the version number you installed. Right-click that application and left-click `Open File Location`.

This should bring you to your `Start Menu/Programs` shortcuts. Right-click `GIMP` again and left-click `Open File Location` once more.

Now we should be in the `Program Files/GIMP 2/bin` folder. We'll copy the path to this folder by Left-clicking anywhere to the right of all the URL text.

This will highlight the URL blue, press `Ctrl+C` to copy this text.

Back in Blender: If you accidentally closed the Preferences window; left-click `Edit` -> `Preferences`
![EditPreferences](../public/images/cape-beginnersguide/edit-preferences.png)

Next we'll select `File Paths` in the left navigation bar.  Then click the drop-down arrow next to `Applications`.
![EditPreferences](../public/images/cape-beginnersguide/filepaths-applications.png)

Then left-click the `folder icon` to the right of the `Image Editor` field.
![Placeholder](../public/images/cape-beginnersguide/openfileviewer.png)

Now we'll paste our `GIMP 2/bin` path we copied earlier.  

With our new window we just opened in Blender, left-click on the URL bar and after it's highlighted blue press `Ctrl+V` to paste the path then press `ENTER`.  

After that we need to find the `gimp-x.x.exe` file. In my case, I have GIMP 2.10 so the filename is `gimp-2.10.exe`.

Once you find it, left-click it once. 

After that click the blue `Accept` button on the bottom right of the window.

Our last step in this course is to close Blender.

We have now completed our Setup Section. Well done soldier.
