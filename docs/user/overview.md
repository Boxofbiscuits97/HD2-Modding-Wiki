# Getting Started

You've likely landed on the page because you're a complete novice to Helldivers 2 modding. If you've never installed and played with any mods, this is the place with you.

::: info
If you're looking to start creating mods, go to the [Developer Section](/dev/overview)
:::

## Nexus

All mods created for Helldivers 2 are upload to the [Nexus Mods Site](https://www.nexusmods.com/games/helldivers2).

Once you have located a mod you want to install. Go to their files page and look for the downloads. You will more than likely want to manual download mods even if you are using a mod manager unless the manager you are using has a Nexus Integration such as [Arsenal](./mod%20manager/arsenal)

Some mods may have multiple downloads that you wish to get. Make sure you download both files.

## Mod Managers

Once you have obtained the mods you wish to install, you will want to use a mod manager to get them into the game.

### Go to the [Mod Managers Section](./mod%20manager/overview)

## Manually Installing Mods

::: danger STOP
It is highly reccomended that you use a [Mod Manager](./mod%20manager/overview) instead of installing mods manually!
:::

Most files are packaged for mod managers so you will have to unzip them for manual installation.

Any and all files ending in the extention `patch_#` with any number are the files you are looking for.

You can place these patch files in the `/data/` folder of your Helldivers 2 game directory.
