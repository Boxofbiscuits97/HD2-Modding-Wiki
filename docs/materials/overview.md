# Materials

Materials are what is actually applied to your model so that you textures can display on them. Each different material visually interprets textures in different ways. 

Most material presets do not translate transparency but some do have transparency in different forms.

::: warning
# Read this section only if you are using Legacy Weights or are using a prior SDK version lower than 3.0

Material amount be <u>**equal**</u> to the amount of materials on the object you are replacing if it is a `LOD`, even if you do not use all said materials.

For example, the SR-24 Brawny Arm Right part has 2 materials. You must have 2 materials on your modded arm part as well.

You cannot go over the material amount of the base game or else you will <u>**instantly crash**</u> the game on start-up.

There are very specific cases where you can add materials to an object, but this is rare and only really applictable to weapons and props. Please refer to [this](./extra-material) section to learn more about adding extra materials to an object.

View [this](../textures/texture-atlas) section on how to combine texture sets into a single `texture atlas` so that you can adhere to the object's material constraints.
