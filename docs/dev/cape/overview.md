## Required Programs

#### [Blender 4.0](https://www.blender.org/download/previous-versions/)
The main program you will be using for the creation of mods
You can also download off of Steam. Just make sure you go to the properties of Blender and turn on the 4.0 setting in the Betas tab.

::: warning
Blender Version **4** is absolutely required. 

Any version from 4.0 to 4.3 will suffice but versions beyond WILL NOT WORK.

The main modding tool for Helldivers 2 in the form of a Blender addon.
